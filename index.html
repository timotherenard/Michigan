		<h2> Reunion Island</h2>
		<p>Reunion Island is a French island in the Indian Ocean near Madagascar.
		
		It is a volcanic island born some three million years ago with the emergence of the Piton des Neiges volcano. 
		It has an altitude of 3,070.5 m (10,074 ft), the highest peak in the Mascarene Islands and the Indian Ocean. 
		The eastern part of the island is constituted by the Piton de la Fournaise, a much more recent volcano (500,000 years old)
		which is considered one of the most active on the planet. The emerged part of the island represents only a small percentage 
		(about 3%) of the underwater mountain that forms it.

		In addition to volcanism, the relief of the island is very uneven due to active erosion. The center shelters three vast cirques dug
		by erosion (Salazie, Mafate and Cilaos) and the slopes of the island are furrowed by numerous rivers digging gullies, estimated at 
		least 600, generally deep and whose torrents cut the sides of the mountains up to several hundreds of meters deep. 
		Its unique topography allow the island a lot of different micro-climate. 
		Due to the east wind and the mountain, the east of the island is very humid and the west is very dry. 
		The mountain also allow different temperature in altitude.

		<h2> A biodiversity Hotspot</h2>
		<p> This variety in climate allow very different plants and animals to inhabit the different part of the island.
		At the east it will be humid tropical forest, at the west it will ressemble a savannah and at high altitude the biodiversity will be very different with small plants and lichen.
		The fact that this is an island will also increase the number of endemic species (species existing only here).
		All this thing explain why Reunion island is a biodiversity hotspot.</p>
