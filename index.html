		<h2> Reunion Island</h2>
			<p>Reunion Island is a French island in the Indian Ocean near Madagascar.
		
			It is a volcanic island born some three million years ago with the emergence of the Piton des Neiges volcano. 
			It has an altitude of 3,070.5 m (10,074 ft), the highest peak in the Mascarene Islands and the Indian Ocean. 
			The eastern part of the island is constituted by the Piton de la Fournaise, a much more recent volcano (500,000 years old)
			which is considered one of the most active on the planet. The emerged part of the island represents only a small percentage 
			(about 3%) of the underwater mountain that forms it.

			In addition to volcanism, the relief of the island is very uneven due to active erosion. The center shelters three vast cirques dug
			by erosion (Salazie, Mafate and Cilaos) and the slopes of the island are furrowed by numerous rivers digging gullies, estimated at 
			least 600, generally deep and whose torrents cut the sides of the mountains up to several hundreds of meters deep. 
		
			The island of Reunion is characterized by a humid tropical climate, tempered by the oceanic influence of the trade winds blowing from east to west. 
			The climate of Reunion is characterized by its great variability, mainly due to the imposing relief of the island, which is at the origin of numerous microclimates.

			As a result, there are strong disparities in rainfall between the windward coast in the east and the leeward coast in the west, 
			and in temperature between the warmer coastal areas and the relatively cooler highland areas.

			<h2> A biodiversity Hotspot</h2>
			<p> This variety in climate allow very different plants and animals to inhabit the different part of the island.
				Reunion has a very high rate of endemic species, with more than 850 native plants (of natural origin and present before the arrival of humans), 
				of which 232 are endemic to the island of Reunion (only present on the island), as well as numerous species endemic to the Mascarene archipelago. 
				Finally, the flora of Reunion is distinguished from that of equatorial tropical forests by the low height and density of the canopy, probably due 
				to adaptation to cyclones, and by a very specific vegetation, in particular a strong presence of epiphytic plants (growing on other plants), 
				such as orchids, bromeliads and cacti, but also ferns, lichens and mosses.
